This is my home page on the world wide web. It's my face in a ball. You can
throw the ball around using your mouse. Try it.

I built this nonsense using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) and [Create Elm
App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app). It was a total riot.

To run this locally, type something like this:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can create a production build and deploy to GitHub pages like so:

```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
